# Samar's Thought Process 🧕🏾

- starting with react was a bit challenging to get used after using regular shmegular JS but not hard! looking through reacts documentation to understand what is different helped. I was in charge of the backend of the web application so after creating the registration send REST APIs to the server took a while for me the understand how to do in react. So grateful for the mentors that were around the hackathon willing to help! Without them I would have not be able to get to this stage of the project!
- CodeClassifiers code helped me understanding how to link it to the node.js server and from there my previous experience with user forms and MongoDB picked up.
- Sadly I was unable to find out why the req.session.loggedin stayed undefined therefore when users login the Nav orginally was supposed to change to one for a logged in user.
