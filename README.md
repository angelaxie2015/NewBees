Bees are very important to the fragile ecosystem we have today. With the world losing 30% of honeybee colonies every year, it would be scary to imagine what would happen if they truly do go extinct! Those little hard workers are responsible for 1/3 of crop pollination! 

The world has always been a delicate cycle of give and take, one humans tend to forget about when lost in greed. 

Well for those who care about the enivornment and have already found their hobby in bee keeping, NewBees is for them! NewBees is a platform that cultivates new beekeeper and spectators alike (in hopes of pulling them to the greener side of the world üå≤) 


The aim of NewBees is really to increase awareness to the little bees as well as to contribute to the increase in honeybee colonies around the world! One beekeeper at a time üêù



# Samar's Thought Process üßïüèæ

- starting with react was a bit challenging to get used after using regular shmegular JS but not hard! looking through reacts documentation to understand what is different helped. I was in charge of the backend of the web application so after creating the registration send REST APIs to the server took a while for me the understand how to do in react. So grateful for the mentors that were around the hackathon willing to help! Without them I would have not be able to get to this stage of the project!
- CodeClassifiers code helped me understanding how to link it to the node.js server and from there my previous experience with user forms and MongoDB picked up.
- Sadly I was unable to find out why the req.session.loggedin stayed undefined therefore when users login the Nav orginally was supposed to change to one for a logged in user.

## Inspiration

‚ÄúAccording to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. It's wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway, because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.‚Äù                                    --- "Bee Movie"

As the team was brainstorming possible project ideas, we came across this website of bees and began a whole conversation of Entomophobia, the fear of insects. Yet despite our fear, we can't deny how insects contributes to a great part of our life, especially bees. 

Can you "bee"-lieve in the significance of bees? They provide us with not only sweet honey but also the crop that we eat on a daily basis. Their contributions doesn't just end here. Bees are also part of our entertainment. 

I'm not sure about you, but the "Bee Movie" brought us lots of fun back in our environmental science class in high school, especially given the fact that my teacher is a beekeeper himself to help preserve the number of bees. He talked to us about the two hives he's been having as well as how he examines the queens of each hive each day. He also mentioned that as a new beekeeper, he wasn't sure what to feed to the different types of bees; not to mention how panic he was when one of the queens died. As a new beekeeper, my environmental science teacher consulted lots of people within the city. He even went to beekeeper meetups to communicate with other beekeepers, yet that still wasn't enough for him to keep up with the process üò¢. 

Right now, given the COVID situation, it becomes even harder to find people and organizations to meet up and talk to. So, we came up with the idea of creating a social media for beginner beekeepers where they can communicate with each other, get advise from the internet, as well as learn new concepts. 

This way, we will be able to inspire more to stay in the beekeeping process, which in term will help to preserve the bee population. With the world losing 30% of honeybee colonies every year, we really can't slow down our process to protect them as they are responsible for 1/3 of crop pollination! That being said, one beekeeper at a time! üêù

## What it does

NewBees is a web application intended specifically for newbies in beekeeping. It allows users to register and log in, to make posting such as questions regarding the process, to share images of the beekeeping process, to ask a chatBot about beekeeping terminologies, and to participate in a competition on beekeeping knowledges through daily quizzes. 

## How we built it

We used canva for our wireframe design, programmed in React, Node, and MongoDB for the creating the web application, and employed react-chatbot-kit to create the chatbot. As with the data on bee terminologies, we utilized data from BetterBee. 

In addition, all of the bee images we used in this project are designed by our friend Haohui Bao. Here are just some of the collections:

Here is the structure of our code:

We had multiple features such as chatbot, feeds, and register/login. For each of the features, we had multiple sub-components as well. Such as the feed and post-message components within the feed feature. We also had a navigation bar which incorporated bootstrap styling.

We hosted our website on domain.com with the .space extension as newbees.space. However, the hosting takes 24 hours to go through.
