# 🐝 About NewBees 🐝

Bees are very important to the fragile ecosystem we have today. With the world losing 30% of honeybee colonies every year, it would be scary to imagine what would happen if they truly do go extinct! Those little hard workers are responsible for 1/3 of crop pollination! 

The world has always been a delicate cycle of give and take, one humans tend to forget about when lost in greed. 

Well for those who care about the enivornment and have already found their hobby in bee keeping, NewBees is for them! NewBees is a platform that cultivates new beekeeper and spectators alike (in hopes of pulling them to the greener side of the world 🌲) 


The aim of NewBees is really to increase awareness to the little bees as well as to contribute to the increase in honeybee colonies around the world! One beekeeper at a time 🐝



# Samar's Thought Process 🧕🏾

- starting with react was a bit challenging to get used after using regular shmegular JS but not hard! looking through reacts documentation to understand what is different helped. I was in charge of the backend of the web application so after creating the registration send REST APIs to the server took a while for me the understand how to do in react. So grateful for the mentors that were around the hackathon willing to help! Without them I would have not be able to get to this stage of the project!
- CodeClassifiers code helped me understanding how to link it to the node.js server and from there my previous experience with user forms and MongoDB picked up.
- Sadly I was unable to find out why the req.session.loggedin stayed undefined therefore when users login the Nav orginally was supposed to change to one for a logged in user.
